    "content": "# Tools in Data Science - May 2025\n\n[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- [2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268)\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more.

It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)\n- LLMs grade you -- unpredictably.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)\n- The ROE is hard.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n\n**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>But it's probably worth it.</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- [Course experience and farewell post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/course-experience-and-farewell-post/173247)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>\n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>If you passed, don't enroll again</strong></summary>\n\nThe course is public, so you can always audit it.\n\nAlso, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).\n\n</details>\n\n<summary><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></summary>\n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.\n\n</details>\n\n## We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\n\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the [commit history](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for changes.\n\n1. **[Development Tools](development-tools.md)** and concepts to **build** models and apps.\n2. **[Deployment Tools](deployment-tools.md)** and concepts to **publish** what you built.\n3. **[Large Language Models](large-language-models.md)** that make your work easier and your apps smarter.\n4. **[Data Sourcing](data-sourcing.md)** to get data from the web, files, and databases.\n5. **[Data Preparation](data-preparation.md)** to clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.\n6. **[Data Analysis](data-analysis.md)** to find surprising insights in the data.\n7. **[Data Visualization](data-visualization.md)** to communicate those insights as visual stories.\n\n## Anyone can audit this course\n\nEveryone has access to:\n\n- Course content at <https://tds.s-anand.net/>\n- [Evaluations](#evaluations-are-mostly-open-internet)\n\nYou can solve these questions any time and check your answers before the submission dates.\n\nOnly [enrolled students](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) can participate in [Discourse](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34), get project evaluations, take the final end-term, or get a certificate.\n\nThose auditing can join the [TDS 2025 May Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/tds-2025-05) for announcements.\n\n## Evaluations are mostly open Internet\n\nTentative dates:\n\n| Exam                                       | Type                     | Weight |          Release Date |       Submission Date |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -----: | --------------------: | --------------------: |\n| GA: Graded assignments                     | Best 4 out of 7          |    15% |                       |                       |\n| [Graded Assignment 1][GA1] [Discuss][GA1D] | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Thu 01 May 2025 |       Sun 18 May 2025 |\n| [Graded Assignment 2][GA2] [Discuss][GA2D] | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Thu 05 May 2025 |       Sun 25 May 2025 |\n| [Graded Assignment 3][GA3] [Discuss][GA3D] | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Fri 20 May 2025 |       Sun 01 Jun 2025 |\n| P1: Project 1                              | Online open-Internet     |    20% |       Fri 16 May 2025 |       Sat 14 Jun 2025 |\n| Graded Assignment 4                        | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Wed 11 Jun 2025 |       Sun 22 Jun 2025 |\n| Graded Assignment 5                        | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Wed 18 Jun 2025 |       Sun 29 Jun 2025 |\n| Graded Assignment 6                        | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Wed 02 Jul 2025 |       Sun 13 Jul 2025 |\n| ROE: Remote Online Exam                    | Online open-Internet MCQ |    20% | Sun 20 Jul 2025 13:00 | Sun 20 Jul 2025 13:45 |\n| Graded Assignment 7                        | Online open-Internet MCQ |        |       Wed 16 Jul 2025 |       Sun 27 Jul 2025 |\n| P2: Project 2                              | Online open-Internet     |    20% |       Fri 11 Jul 2025 |        Fri 8 Aug 2025 |\n| F: Final end-term                          | In-person, no internet   |    25% |       Sun 31 Aug 2025 |       Sun 31 Aug 2025 |\n\n[GA1]: https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga1\n[GA2]: https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga2\n[GA3]: https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga3\n[GA1D]: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-may-2025/173524\n[GA2D]: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-may-2025/173525\n[GA3D]: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-may-2025/175592\n\nUpdates:\n\n- 5 May 2025:\n  - GA1 submission date postponed from 11 May to 18 May 2025\n  - GA2 submission date postponed from 18 May to 25 May 2025\n  - ~~GA3 submission date **preponed** from 01 Jun to 25 May 2025 since there's a break the week after~~\n\n### Notes\n\n- **[Graded Assignment 1][GA1] checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n- **Remote exams are open and hard**\n  - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...\n  - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)\n- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.\n- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.\n- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)\n- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.\n  - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.\n\n## Constantly check communications\n\nCheck these three links regularly to keep up with the course.\n\n1. **[Seek Notifications](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** for Course Notifications.

    "content": "# Large Language Models\n\nThis module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs).\n\n**LLMs incur a cost.** For the May 2025 batch, use [aipipe.org](https://aipipe.org/) as a proxy.\nEmails with `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` get a **$1 per calendar month** allowance. (Don't exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let's use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'\n```\n\nOr using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/):\n\n```bash\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small\n```\n\n**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request.\n\n## AI Proxy - Jan 2025\n\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don't exceed that.\n\n**Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically:\n\n1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`\n2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you.\n"

    "content": "# Data Sourcing\n\nBefore you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it.\nAnd what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.\n\nThere are three ways you can get the data.\n\n1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1LyblMkJzOo)\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n- [IMDb Datasets](https://imdb.com/interfaces/)\n- [Download the IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)\n- [Explore the Internet Movie Database](https://gramener.com/imdb/)\n- [What does the world search for?](https://gramener.com/search/)\n- [HowStat - Cricket statistics](https://howstat.com/cricket/home.asp)\n- [Cricket Strike Rates](https://gramener.com/cricket/)\n"

For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle.\n\nThis section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze.\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [Presentation used in the video](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gb0QnPUN1YOwM_O5EqDdXUdL-5Azp1Tf/view)\n- [Scraping assembly elections - Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SP8yVxzmofQO48-yXF3rujqWk2iM0KSl)\n- [Assembly election results (CSV)](https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/blob/master/assembly-elections/assembly.csv)\n- [`pdftotext` software](https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html)\n- [OpenRefine software](https://openrefine.org)\n- [The most persistent party](https://gramener.com/election/parliament#story.ddp)\n- [TN assembly election cartogram](https://gramener.com/election/cartogram?ST_NAME=Tamil%20Nadu)\n\n[![Data Preparation - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dF3zchJJKqk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/dF3zchJJKqk)\n"
